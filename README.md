## ✨ Why Keyscope?

While existing tools are heavy (Electron-based) or lack support for modern Valkey features, Keyscope runs natively on [Dart](https://dart.dev/) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), powered by the high-performance [keyscope_client](https://pub.dev/packages/keyscope_client) and dense_table. Keyscope supports [Redis](https://redis.io), [Valkey](https://valkey.io), and [Dragonfly](https://www.dragonflydb.io/), with built‑in **Multilingual (i18n) support** for global users.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **High Performance:** Render 100k+ keys smoothly using `dense_table` virtualization.
* **Cluster Ready:** First-class support for Redis/Valkey Cluster & Sentinel.
* **Secure:** Built-in SSH Tunneling and TLS (SSL) support.
* **Multi-Platform:** Runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
* **Multilingual:** Internationalization (i18n) with full multi-language support.
* **Developer Friendly:** JSON viewer, CLI console, and dark mode optimized for engineers.

## 🛠 Powered By

Built with ❤️ using [keyscope_client](https://pub.dev/packages/keyscope_client) and dense_table.

* **[keyscope_client](https://pub.dev/packages/keyscope_client):** The engine behind the connectivity.
* **dense_table:** The engine behind the UI performance.
  > Merged into Keyscope UI. Functionality now included directly in Keyscope.

## 🌐 Translations

### Internationalization (i18n)

Keyscope provides multilingual support through the `assets/i18n.csv` file.  

This file defines translation keys and maps them to localized values across multiple languages (English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Thai, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, Portuguese, etc.).

Each row defines a translation key (e.g., `welcome`, `languageTitle`) and its corresponding localized strings. 
For example:

- `welcome` → "Welcome %name$s!" in English, "%name$s님, 환영합니다!" in Korean, "ようこそ、%name$sさん！" in Japanese, etc.

During the build process, this CSV is compiled into `lib/i18n.dart`, ensuring that Keyscope can dynamically render UI text in the user’s preferred language.

### Language Order

The columns in `assets/i18n.csv` follow this order:

```
keys,en,ko,ja,zh_CN,zh_TW,id,vi,th,de,de_CH,fr,it,es,ru,pt_PT,pt_BR
```

For instance, the `languageTitle` row maps each language name to its localized form:

```
languageTitle,English,한국어,日本語,简体中文,繁體中文,Bahasa Indonesia,Tiếng Việt,ภาษาไทย,Deutsch,Schweizerdeutsch,Français,Italiano,Español,Русский,Português (Portugal),Português (Brasil)
```

## 🔨 Build

To build **Keyscope**, you need to generate the `i18n.dart` file first.

This can be done by running:

```sh
dart run setup.dart
```

Alternatively, you can use the dedicated i18n generator:

```sh
dart run tool/i18n_generator.dart
```

The i18n generator compiles all translation resources into `lib/i18n.dart`, ensuring proper multi-language support.  
This file is required for a successful build.
